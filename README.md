In game folder,

  In casting folder,

    actor.py was pre-done
    cast.py was pre-done

    Probably in this folder we want to create a rock and a gem class.
    They will inherit from the actor class, and it will probably only want three things:

      First, set the gems to always show * and rocks O.
      (Actor class has a self._text attribute, use this?)

      Second, a single function that when called, will change the player's score by +1 or -1
      (or maybe we'll add that functionality another way somewhere else?)

      Third, when the rock or gem gets touched, it must be removed.


  In directing folder,

    director.py was pre-done, except for get_inputs and do_updates. If we can, let's try to only do things to those two sections if we can help it.

    In get_inputs,

      Track keyboard movements left and right (if we're feeling cheeky, used wasd as well as arrow keys)

    In do_updates,

      Do whatever we can think of



  In services folder,
    keyboard_service.py and video_service.py are pre-done. Do not touch

  In services folder,
    color.py and point.py are pre-done. Do not touch


In main,

  Figure out what we need to do
